# Networking in Rust
With rust moving towards being my primary programming language, I thought it was about
time I finally sat down and learnt some Network programming.

To guide my exploration of rust's networking capabilities, I'll be using a book called networking in rust - its not as in depth as I would like, but I do have to commend it on its wide coverage of different networking approaches.

Unfortunately, unlike prior endeavours, Networking is always quite closely linked to implementation, and "learning" networking boils down to memorizing the interface your language of choice uses.


In aim of this goal, while going through the book, I will be compiling a set of questions reviewing the various interfaces etc.
